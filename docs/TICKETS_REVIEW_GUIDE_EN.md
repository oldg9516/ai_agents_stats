# Ticket Review Guide for Qualified Agents

## Purpose of Review

Understand how accurately the AI agent evaluates AI response quality. Identify cases where a ticket was given a "bad" status, even though the AI response was good enough to send to the customer.

This helps:
- Improve AI quality statistics accuracy
- Identify error patterns in AI reviewer performance
- Find opportunities for prompt improvements

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Go to Tickets Review Page

- URL: `/tickets-review` (or `/en/tickets-review` for English version)

### Step 2: Set Up Filters

1. **Version (Prompt Version)**: Select `v3` (or another version to review)
2. **Classification**: Select "bad" statuses to review:
   - `CRITICAL_FACT_ERROR` — first priority
   - `MAJOR_FUNCTIONAL_OMISSION`
   - `MINOR_INFO_GAP`
   - `CONFUSING_VERBOSITY`
3. **Review Status**: Filter by `unprocessed` to see only unreviewed tickets

### Step 3: Select a Ticket to Review

- Click on a row in the table
- The detailed ticket view page will open

### Step 4: Review Ticket Information

The ticket page shows:
- **Ticket ID** — ticket number
- **Classification** — current classification with color indicator
- **Category/Subcategory** — request category
- **Version** — prompt version
- **Agent** — who processed the ticket

**Three key blocks to compare:**
1. **Customer Request** — original customer request
2. **Agent Response** — response sent by the human agent
3. **AI Response** — response generated by AI

### Step 5: Verify in Zoho

1. Click the **"Open in Zoho"** button (external link icon at the top of the page)
2. In Zoho, check:
   - **Conversation history** — context of communication with the customer
   - **Priority information** — if additional data is needed
   - **Customer subscription status** — if relevant

### Step 6: Make a Decision

Ask yourself: **"Does the AI response actually contain a critical error, or could it have been sent to the customer?"**

**If the AI response was CORRECT** (no error or insignificant):
1. Select yourself from the **Reviewer** list
2. Leave a comment (optional): e.g., "AI response is correct, classification is overstated"
3. ✅ Check the **"Approve AI Answer"** box
4. Click **"Mark as Processed"**

**If the AI response actually CONTAINS AN ERROR**:
1. Select yourself from the **Reviewer** list
2. Leave a comment (recommended): describe what exactly the error is
3. ❌ **DO NOT check** the "Approve AI Answer" box
4. Click **"Mark as Processed"**

## Evaluation Criteria

### When to Check "Approve AI Answer" ✅

- AI response is complete and correct
- AI response contains all necessary information
- Differences between AI and human are stylistic
- Human changes are preference, not error correction
- AI response could have been sent to customer without edits

### When NOT to Check "Approve AI Answer" ❌

- AI response contains a factual error
- AI response misses critically important information
- AI response could mislead the customer
- AI response doesn't answer the customer's question
- Sending the AI response would have caused a problem

---

## Comment Examples

**When approving AI:**
- "AI response is correct, agent made only stylistic changes"
- "No factual error, information is accurate"
- "Could have been sent as auto-reply"

**When NOT approving AI:**
- "AI indicated wrong delivery date"
- "Missing subscription status information"
- "Response doesn't comply with company return policy"

## Important Notes

1. **Be objective**: The goal is not to "inflate" statistics, but to get a real picture of AI quality

2. **Document decisions**: Comments will help understand error patterns in the future

3. **Check context in Zoho**: Sometimes AI error is only visible when understanding the full history

4. **Pay attention to patterns**: If one type of error repeats — it's a signal for prompt improvement

5. **Excluded statuses**: `EXCL_WORKFLOW_SHIFT` and `EXCL_DATA_DISCREPANCY` don't require review — they are excluded from quality calculation
